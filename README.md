# grid_traveller_problem_using_dynamic_programming
A Java code for grid traveller problem in which a person can move only in right and bottom directions in a given grid. We have to calcuate the number of ways
in which the grid can be traversed from top left to the bottom right corner, using only the allowed movement directions.
To lower the computation time Dynamic Programming and for large number BigInteger is used.
